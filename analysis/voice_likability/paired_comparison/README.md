## Analysis: Paired Comparison

The data from Listening Test 7 is analyzed (see [listening_tests](https://github.com/laufergall/Subjective_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/doc/listening_tests)).

### Matlab

"main_GenerateMatricesFromJavaOutput.m" reads the subjective data from the 13 listeners generated by the test GUI (Java). It then calls, for each listener:

* "f_output2dissimilaritymatrix": generates a dissimilarity matrix. Matrix of distances between the likability expressed for voice "A" over voice "B" and viceversa, based on the value selected on the slider.
* "f_output2preferencematrix": generates a preference matrix. Matrix of values indicating whether listeners prefer voice "A" or voice "B". Value in the slider is binarized.

Afterwards, it combines all created matrices:

* ''f_combineDissimilarityMatrices": by averaging over dissimilarity matrices for all listeners
* "f_combinePreferenceMatrices": by summing preference matrices of all listeners



This repository contains in this folder the generated dissimilatityMatrices per listener and combined (named 'dissimilarity_total.csv'); and preferenceMatrices per listener and combined (named 'choiceFrequencies.csv').

The combined matrices are then used by the R scripts.
