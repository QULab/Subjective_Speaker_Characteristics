## Analysis: Paired Comparison

The data from Listening Test 7 is analyzed (see [listening_tests](https://github.com/laufergall/Subjective_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/doc/listening_tests)).



### Matlab

"main_GenerateMatricesFromJavaOutput.m" reads the subjective data from the 13 listeners generated by the test GUI (Java). It then calls, for each listener:

* "f_output2dissimilaritymatrix": generates a dissimilarity matrix. Matrix of distances between the likability expressed for voice "A" over voice "B" and viceversa, based on the value selected on the slider.
* "f_output2preferencematrix": generates a preference matrix. Matrix of values indicating whether listeners prefer voice "A" or voice "B". Value in the slider is binarized. 

Afterwards, it combines all created matrices:

* ''f_combineDissimilarityMatrices": by averaging over dissimilarity matrices for all listeners
* "f_combinePreferenceMatrices": by summing preference matrices of all listeners: all listeners' responses were then pooled to create the preference matrix (of size 15 x 15), in which each element $\gamma_{ij}$ represents the number of times that voice $i$ had been liked over the voice $j$.



This repository contains in [this folder](https://github.com/laufergall/Subjective_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/data/subjective_ratings/data_listeningtest7) the generated dissimilatityMatrices per listener and combined (named 'dissimilaritymatrix_total.csv'); and preferenceMatrices per listener and combined (named 'preferencematrix_total.csv'). Matrices individual for each listener are named according to the pseudonyms of the [NSC corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus)) (these female listeners were also speakers, as described [here](https://github.com/laufergall/Subjective_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/doc/listening_tests)).

The matrix 'preferencematrix_total.csv' is then used by the R script.

The script "simulate_paired_comparison_data_FemalesRateMales.m" takes subjective data of the direct scaling test (Listening Test 6), given by the same 13 females listeners who performed Listening Test 7, and generates "simulated" paired comparison data: ['preferencematrix_from_directscaling_FemalesRateMales.csv']().
