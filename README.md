## This repository

As part of my [Postdoc project](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=lfernandez), I collected subjective ratings of speaker and voice characteristics. In this repository, I explore data resulting from listening tests with speech stimuli from the [Nautilus Speaker Characterization (NSC) Corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus):

* Factor analysis to find traits of social speaker characteristics (SC), with data from Listening Test 1.

​    The resulting dimensions (referred to as "traits") were: _warmth_, _attractiveness_, _confidence_, _compliance_, _maturity_. 

​    "WAAT" stands for "warmth-attractiveness", the first two traits resulting from this factor analysis.

* Factor analysis to find dimensions of voice descriptions (VD), with data from Listening Test 2.
* Statistical data analysis of effects of  [telephone degradations](https://github.com/laufergall/ML_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/data/distortions) (channel bandwidth) on speaker characteristics, with data from Listening Test 3.
* Statistical data analysis of effects of  [telephone degradations](https://github.com/laufergall/ML_Speaker_Characteristics/tree/master/data/distortions) (channel bandwidth) on voice descriptions, with data from Listening Test 4.
* Analyzing the relationship between speech quality and speakers' WAAT, with data from Listening Test 5.

I also employed these subjective data to perform predictive modeling of speaker characteristics and of the derived speaker traits (see [this](https://github.com/laufergall/ML_Speaker_Characteristics) repository).
