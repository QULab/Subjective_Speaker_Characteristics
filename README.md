As part of my [Postdoc project](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=lfernandez), I collected subjective ratings of speaker and voice characteristics. In this repository, I explore these data:

* Factor analysis to find dimensions of interpersonal speaker characteristics
* Statistical data analysis of effects of communication channels

The raw data from listening tests and the factor scores are included as documentation in the  [Nautilus Speaker Characterization (NSC) Corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus).

I also employed these data to perform [predictive modeling](https://github.com/laufergall/ML_Speaker_Characteristics) of speaker characteristics.
